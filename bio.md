Background:

I was born in Louisville, KY in 1986 and moved to Southern California when I was six months old. 

Programming Background:
I am quite new to programming but have learned a lot in the past 8 months with 3 quarters of the Post-Bacc 
program under my belt. I am excited to continue to learn different aspects of computer science and really want
to learn more about cloud computing. 

Classes taken:
CS161/CS162
CS225
CS325
CS260
CS271

So far my favorite class was CS162 because I thought the level of knowledge of C++ was starting to get to the point
where the assignments were really fun and complex.
